1,Merchants on the [Place] ship watch a young man running in their direction. As he approaches, the merchant questions the young man: "Lad, what is your name? Are you the new worker here to carry goods overland? Why hasn't the port sent more people? Surely, this is not enough for all our goods." "No, my lords", the boy replied. "My name is [Male Name], and though I am poor, it is my greatest wish that one day, my mother may taste the tea from your homeland." He then hands over a sack of coins. The merchant looks sheepishly and then replies, "My son, this is really too little to buy good tea from us, but I am impressed by your filial piety and so will sell you a small amount." The boy is overjoyed and takes the small amount of tea in return for coins. On the way back, however, he is kidnapped by Yellow Turban rebels. Thinking he has nothing to lose, he agrees to join the rebels.
1,The rebels soon realizes that [Male Name] has tea and force him to relinquish it to their overlord [Male Name]. Out of concern for his mother, the boy offers to trade the tea for his jade sword. The rebels see it is a great sword, probably used by previous Emperors, and take it from him, but they refuse to return his tea. Unable to resist, the boy becomes a mere prisoner of the rebels.  However, as they march home, a great warrior attacks the rebels. Although there were more than fifty rebels, the warrior defeats them easily and rescues the boy and [Female Name], a beautiful lady also in captivity of the rebels.
1,"I am truly greatful," [Male Name] says meekly. "I do not know how to repay you, but I really need the tea for my mother. Please take this precious sword as a sign of my gratitude." "A good sword indeed!" The warrior says, taking the sword in admiration. "I am [Male Name]. Technically, I am a wealthy butcher here, but I've always hated these [Color.brightCap] Rebels. Young man, we are friends now, and perhaps one day in the future, we shall meet again."
1,Many years later, [Male Name] marries Lady [Female Name] and watches the government's warrant against the [Color.brightCap] Turban Rebels and sighs. A burly [Male Name] meets him and shouts "Why does the young man sigh?" "My friend!" the man exclaims. I did not think of meeting you again. Together, they meet another great warrior at the tavern and invite him for drinks. The warrior introduces himself "My name is [Male Name]. I killed a corrupt [Administrator] who was trying to harass innocent women." Together, the three men befriend. 
1,They realized that [Male Name] is the scion of the [Dynasty] dynasty and a descendant of the [Administrator] of the East.  He also happens to be the eldest, so he returns him his sword and asks him whether they should swear brotherhood. So they swore brotherhood at [Place], slashing blood from their arms, and saying "Though we may not be born together, let us be brothers that never part even in death." So he became the eldest brother of the brotherhood. [Male Name] the Red-Faced Warrior becomes the second brother, and [Male Name] became the youngest brother. The age of the Three Kingdoms was about to begin.

;RoTKBook2
1,So the three sworn brothers, [Male Name], [Male Name], and [Male Name], took up the challenge and led a small local militia against the [Color.brightCap] Turban Rebels. The Rebels were an extremely powerful force. During the late [Dynasty] dynasty, corruption of the Ten Eunuchs in the Imperial Palace spread over China. A man called [Male Name] claimed to be a sage and offered special healing powers. A great rebellion followed him, and they all wore the colored turban. He was their Supreme Commander. He was also called Commander of the Heavens by his followers.
1,[Male Name]'s militia joined that of his mentor [Male Name]. His mentor was a pugilist who had risen to the ranks of a commander. Together, they had many successes, but eventually the master was beheaded by an evil commissioner. Even during times of troubles, the corruption of the [Dynasty] court was immense.
1,In another battle, [Male Name] rescued the powerful warlord [Male Name] from the rebels. The warlord summoned his savior, but when he realized he was not an official general and only a militia leader, he simply looked past him.
1,[Male Name]'s big break came in his next battle. He ordered his men to carry a rack of ten torches each. They attacked the rebels at night. Though vastly outnumbered, he gave the rebels the perception that he had a vast army. They panicked and could not respond. When he reached their camp, he threw down the torches and burned down the camp. In the ensuing turmoil, he was able to kill [Male Name], a younger brother of [Male Name] who was also known as Commander of the Land.
1,With the victories he earned, [Male Name] was only made a minor district governor. This was because he had little backing in the Imperial Palace. In the meantime, another general [Male Name] was promoted during the same war. This general was instrumental in the defeat of the [Color.brightCap] Turban Rebels, and it was he who crushed the [Male Name] and his other younger brother [Male Name] (known as Commander of the Ghosts).
1,Although [Male Name] had one of China's greatest army, he contributed little to the fight against the [Color.brightCap] Turban Rebels. Nevertheless, he bribed the powerful Ten Eunuchs to turn the story in his favor and emerged as the most powerful warlord in China following this event. The Rebellion was a turning point for the decadent [Dynasty] Empire. Now, the fall of the Dynasty was only a matter of time. Powerful men who would reshape China in their own image arose due to the wars caused by [Male Name] and his Rebels.

;RoTKBook3
1,[Male Name] becomes a minor district governor, and the three brothers, while not immensely wealthy, are satisfied. Their leader is a good man who does not take bribes. His administration is good, and the villagers love him. The three brothers sleep in one bed with great contentment.  One day, an evil commissioner from the Imperial Palace finds fault with them. They fear they have done something wrong and asks the Commissioner what wrong he has committed.
1,The evil man then replies, "You are but a foolâ€¦Nothing more than a hillbilly. Listen, [Male Name]. If you want to progress in civil service, you must learn to make gifts to the nobles like myself. Then, I can give them to the higher-ups, reaching eventually to the Ten Eunuchs. Now go!! Off with you!!" But he could not bribe the honest man, who asks, "My salary is low. How can I pay such gifts?" The commissioner then replies, "I'm only telling this for your own good, hillbilly! You must learn to take bribes and extort money from the villagers. They are not as important as the Ten Eunuchs." The man feels sickened. He tells the story to his brothers. [Male Name] ponders over their ill fortune quietly, but [Male Name] is furious!
1,[Male Name] goes off to the [Administrator]'s guesthouse and beats him up. The officer begs for his life out of pain, but his assailant does not stop. Eventually, [Male Name] realizes what has happened, so he rushes forth to stop his brother.  He now realizes it is impossible for him to keep his job, so he hangs his official district key on the neck of the evil commissioner and says, "You are an evil man. If the [Dynasty] court is so low-down, I can not serve under men as you. Consider this my resignation."
1,The brothers then flee from the governor district office. Some men eventually free the [Administrator] who orders an arrest warrant for [Male Name] and [Male Name], but they are not caught. At first, the eldest planned to return home, but his mother rebuked him for lack of ambition and reveals that his ancestor was the [Administrator] of the East who fell from favor and left the Imperial Palace.  With no place to go, he returns to his sworn brothers. They join the minor warlord [Male Name]'s army. The brothers are back at their ambition now. From patriot to official, and back to being vagabounds.

;RoTKBook4
1,While [Male Name] and his brothers were fleeing, the [Dynasty] court was in turmoil as well. During that time, the Ten Eunuchs were the most powerful men in China, but soon, the Emperor [ChineseMaleFirst] found a beautiful woman and married her. Her name was Empress [ChineseFemaleFirst]. Through her influence, her uneducated brother [Male Name] became Grand General of China. He was only a butcher, but now he had even more power than the Ten Eunuchs.
1,When a rival concubine found favor with the Emperor, [Male Name] had her murdered, much to the chagrin of the Emperor and his mother the Empress Dowager. But he was ruthless. Next, he murdered the Empress Dowager, because she dared to insult his sister the Empress. With the army behind him, he felt himself untouchable. The Emperor was very angry, but could not do anything.
1,Before the Emperor [ChineseMaleFirst] died, he told the Ten Eunuchs, he wanted his younger son Hien-te by the favorite concubine to succeed him. Naturally, [Male Name] would not go along, since he wanted his nephew Crown Prince [ChineseMaleFirst] to rule China. The Ten Eunuchs believed the general was too powerful. They too wanted to get rid of him.  At that time, the general had two important advisors. One of them was [Male Name], who gained fame fighting the [Color.brightCap] Turban Rebels. Another was [Male Name], the powerful warlord of [Place]. They advised the general to murder the Ten Eunuchs, and the Grand General agreed. Together, the two advisors invaded the Palace and murdered many eunuchs, but some of them escaped.
1,They tricked Empress [ChineseMaleFirst] into summoning her brother alone and unarmed into the palace, playing on the way they used to help her when she first entered the palace first as a nameless concubine many years ago.  The Empress wanted the Ten Eunuchs and her brother to reconcile, and thought she would now get her son as Emperor in peace, so she summoned [Male Name].  Trusting his sister, he decided to enter alone.  [Male Name] never trusted anyone and warned his boss not to go, but the man was a stupid bull. He thought he was untouchable, so he went alone and unarmed. "I am Grand General of China," he said. "Who dares challenge me?!? The Ten Eunuchs will come crawling to me like the dogs they are. Why can't I see my sister in private?" But before he could reach the Empress, he was surrounded by the Ten Eunuchs and murdered. They tossed his head outside the courtyard to where the advisors were. The two men, angered beyond reason, invaded the palace and murdered all the Ten Eunuchs. Now, the [Dynasty] Court was in open turmoil.

;RoTKBook5
1,As the Ten Eunuchs were being slaughtered by [Male Name]'s men, two vast armies entered the capital city of [City]. One was led by the patriotic noble [Male Name], while the other larger army was led by [Male Name]. On his way to the capital, he met the two fleeing princes [ChineseMaleFirst] and [ChineseMaleFirst]. The Crown Prince was clearly frightened, but his brother was braver. He faced up to the man and demanded: "Before the Crown Prince, why do you not bow!"
1,[Male Name] was shocked. He went on his knees and bowed to the two princes. He was rather impressed by [ChineseMaleFirst] but felt that the Crown Prince Pian-te was nothing more than a coward. When he entered the Palace, his army was the biggest of all. He expressed his opinion that they should crown the younger Prince as Emperor. [Male Name], a powerful warlord in his own rights, was disgusted and left the capital. But it was [Male Name] who spoke up against the man; "Traitor, how dare you defy the will of Heavens and the laws of the Imperial Family? The Crown Prince is elder and should reign."
1,[Male Name]'s men wanted to strike down [Male Name], but his adopted son, [Male Name], stood by him. Now, his son was no ordinary man but the greatest warrior of the late [Dynasty] period. The war between the two armies would now begin. The protector of the Imperial Family could not be defeated, for his son was a great warrior worth more than a hundred soldiers. In one battle, he almost killed the opposing general, but he managed to flee in time.
1,[Male Name], [Male Name]'s wise son-in-law and advisor, went to talk with his father-in-law: "Master, we can not win this war with [Male Name] by [Male Name]'s side. Our of our generals, [Male Name], is a friend of his son. Tell him to convince the man to our side and shower him with gifts." "Will he betray his own father for us?" the general asked. His advisor said: "He is a great warrior, but he is not cunning." So the general followed his advisor's advice. He ordered his men to take great treasures to the son of his enemy.
1,[Male Name] took the horse in with great admiration. He made up his mind to work for [Male Name], so that night, he entered [Male Name]'s tent alone. "What brings you here, my son?" the great man asked. "Why are you up so late?"  To which his adopted son replied, "Why must I be your son? I am the greatest warrior in China." With that he chopped off his father's head, set fire to the camp, and defected to the enemy, riding on the [Color.brightCap] Hare.
1,Without [Male Name], [Male Name]'s army was helpless. [Male Name], whose army was far bigger, easily crushed them. Finally, the victorious general accepted his enemy's adopted son as his own adopted son. Hence, the young man became known as the "Man with Three Fathers." For first was his real father, second was his noble adopted father, and finally this treacherous general.
1,With [Male Name] by his side, [Male Name] was invincible.  When a noble spoke up against the general at a party, his son dragged him out and chopped his head off instantly before returning for drinks.  His arrogance now unsurpassed, the general ordered Empress [ChineseFemaleFirst] and her son Crown Prince [ChineseMaleFirst] thrown to their death from the balcony of the palace and installed Prince [ChineseMaleFirst] as Emperor of China. As the new Minister of War, the general was the most powerful man in China.

;RoTKBook6
1,[Male Name] was born the son of [Male Name], who was a moderately wealthy merchant. Actually, they were from the [ChineseMaleLast] family. The father was adopted, the son of a powerful eunuch. Hence, it is not surprising that the two families were extremely close.  
1,[Male Name] started his career as a minor captain in the Imperial Palace, but he was respected for his unbendable discipline. In one instance, one of the Ten Eunuchs violated the curfew to do something corrupt. Most captians would not have dared to question them, but the man ordered even this powerful man beaten with sandalwood.  Through his fame, the captain emerged as a favorite of [Male Name], but with the chaos that ensued, he was forced to serve the now all-powerful warlord [Male Name]. Still, he was a cunning man and quickly rose in favor of his new lord.
1,The nobles hated [Male Name], and in one secret meeting, the senior noble [Male Name] was the host. The host was extremely loyal to the [Dynasty] Dynasty, and he was weeping for its fate at the hand of the general when [Male Name] suddenly laughed like a madman.  The host asked, "Why do you laugh like this? Do you not lament at the fate of the Dynasty?! Your family is descended from seven nobles but now, you serve that traitorous general. You should be ashamed of yourself."  His guest replied, "I laugh that the nobility is so weak. What is the point of crying? Why does no one try to rid the land of this tyrant?"  This shocked the host. "How dare you accuse the others when you yourself serve the tyrant himself? What have you done for the Empire?!"
1,[Male Name] stated, "I will kill [Male Name] myself! I have feigned loyalty to win his trust."  His host, [Male Name], replied, "Ha?!? Forgive me. I did not know you were such a patriot. In that case, please take this."  Upon saying that, the host reached out for the priceless Sword of Seven Jewels and handed it to the warrior in appreciation of his volunteering.
1,The next day, [Male Name] went to see [Male Name], hiding the Sword of Seven Jewels in his cloak. He was about to strike the general when [Male Name], the greatest warrior of China, appeared by his side, so he hid the Sword.  "Why are you so late?" said the general.  Thinking quickly, the assassin replied "My horse is old and thin. It is so slow like a donkey, my Lord."  The general laughed, "Haha, no problem. Why didn't you say so? I let my greatest warrior have the greatest horse in China, Great Hare. I think I will also give you a good horse. Servant! Go fetch a good horse for this man."
1,[Male Name] nodded and went out to fetch a horse. Seeing the opportunity, [Male Name] tried to get closer to [Male Name] and stab him. Just then, his servant reappeared! But the assassin's sword was already drawn. Slightly shocked, the general asked "What are you doing?! Are you trying to kill me?"  The man thought quickly, bowed down, and presented the general with the Sword of Seven Jewels and said, "No my Lord, I am here to present this precious sword to you. Sorry to have made you shocked."  The general handled the precious sword admiringly, "Haha, this is indeed a peerless blade. Thank you, my good servant. Try out your new horse."  The would-be assassin replied, "I shall, your grace. I humbly accept your blessings."
1,[Male Name] then sped off with the horse. After a long time, he still didn't return, so [Male Name] got worried. Just then, [Male Name], the general's son-in-law and advisor, entered the room. The general discussed his servant's strange behavior with his advisor. After much consideration, they felt that he was actually conspiring to kill the general, so they placed out an arrest warrant for the man. By then, he had already fled quite a far distance, but at one village, he was finally captured and brought to the [Administrator] [Male Name]. The administrator was a good and thoughtful man, so he asked, "I heard that you are one of the Minister's favorite. I wonder why you have tried to betray him."  The fugitive stated, "I am descended from seven generations of nobles, and we are loyal to the [Dynasty]. I'm not merely serving a tyrant just for my own good."  The administrator was deeply touched, so he said, "I too am a loyal servant of the Empire. I will join a great man like you."
1,Having said that, [Male Name] freed [Male Name] from his death sentence. He resigned from his post as [Administrator], sold all his possessions, and fled with him from the authorities. While fleeing, the two comrades stopped at the house of a man who was a brother of the fugitive's father. The man went out to buy beef for a party. The two grew suspicious when the "uncle" was away for so long. Below, they heard sounds of knives sharpening and one of the servants saying "Get the rope! Tie them up!" Suddenly, the comrades grew suspicious that the uncle would report them to the authorities. Having thought that, they went down and killed the entire family out of self-defense. Then, they found out that they had been mistaken. The ropes and knives were for the pigs for the feast, not them. Having realized their great mistake, the two comrades fled the house. On the way, they met the unsuspecting uncle who asked "Why are you going so soon?"  Said the fugitives, "We have something to attend to." The uncle replied, "It is a pity. I thought we would have a feast together, but understand you are on a run. Perhaps next time."
1,Just then, [Male Name] thought; "Well, he may not have been ill-intended in the beginning, but if he finds out his entire family is killed, he will certainly hunt us down with the authorities' help." Having thought thus, he yelled "Uncle!"  The Uncle looked back, "What is it, son?" whereupon the man killed him.  That night, [Male Name] asked his fellow fugitive if he regretted his act, but he said "Of course not. These things are normal in war. I would rather betray the world rather than have the world betray me."  Thus, the man lost faith in his friend. As the latter slept, he thought of killing him, but changed his mind. "Why should I dirty my hand on this evil man?" Then, he left.  The fugitive only realized what happened in the morning, and he was sad. But he still believed what he did was the right thing. After that, he faked a royal decree against [Male Name] with the help of his father, and created a decent sized army.  Now, the fugitive was readying himself to face the most powerful man in the [Dynasty] Empire.

;RoTKBook7
1,When he arrived home, [Male Name] gained the help of his wealthy father [Male Name]. The two of them forged documents calling people to arms against [Male Name] on behalf of the [Dynasty] emperor. Not many people questioned the authenticity of the documents, as people all over the land hated the general, so the armies of seventeen warlords assembled with the father and son.  Then, it was time to elect the great army leader. The son was in a position to nominate himself, but instead, he nominated [Male Name] of [Place] who had the largest army. This man also came from a powerful family. The next question was who would lead the first attack. The volunteer was none other than [Male Name], warlord of [Place]. He was known as "the Little Tiger" for his prowess in battle. In one time, he single-handedly crushed a group of pirates. In the first battle, he easily defeated [Male Name]'s general and marched towards the capital city of [City]. During this time, he found an ancient Imperial Seal. He felt this was Heaven's way of telling him that he was destined for greatness, and perhaps, it was.
1,In the meanwhile, Supreme Commander [Male Name] grew jealous of [Male Name] and didn't send him reinforcements. In the end, he had to retreat. He was very angry and wanted to kill his superior, but the general put the blame on one of his advisors and beheaded the scapegoat. Later, he got wind of the Imperial Seal. He accused his subordinate of being a rebel. The [Place] forces and those of [Place], led by the man's ally, [Male Name], pursued the accused traitor, and he barely escaped with a few men. He vowed to get revenge on both generals.  The glue that held the revolutionary army together was weakening. [Male Name], one of [Male Name]'s generals, defeated the revolutionaries in several skirmishes. The revolutionaries could not field a great general after the "traitor" left, and were in panic.
1,Suddenly, [Male Name] who had followed [Male Name] to serve in [Male Name]'s army volunteered himself, but [Male Name] was arrogant.  The great general asked, "How dare you present yourself? You are only a private. Do you think you even have a chance of beating a mighty general like [Male Name]?"  [Male Name] said, "Wait, my lordship. Let this warrior have his chance."  For he had looked at the man in admiration, and he saw greatness in him. He gave him a cup of hot tea and said "Brave young man, let me drink to your courage. May you bring us victory." To which the man replied, "My general, let me take your drink once the task is done." So the warrior rode out and slew the general in a single stroke.  He came back and drank the tea before it had cooled. Such was the greatness of the man!!!
1,The revolutionaries now approached [City], and [Male Name] felt that defeat was imminent. So he ordered all the imperial [Dynasty] graves to be uprooted, and he also took the treasures from the wealthy noble families and ordered everyone in the capital to evacuate to [Place]. [Male Name] urged the revolutionaries to invade, as there was no point resting on their laurels in the now-captured capitol. However, [Male Name] was a complacent man, and he insisted on staying. The arrogant general then invaded on his own, but was ambushed and defeated by [Male Name]. He managed to return to the city and was welcomed by the commanding general, but by then, he was disgusted by the commander's lack of leadership qualities, so he left. Without his presence as the charismatic glue of the revolutionary army, they quickly fell apart. So this is how the revolution ended; an empty victory with the capture of the capitol, but the enemy remained firmly in control of power.

;RoTKBook8
1,After [Male Name] returned to his base at [Place], he decided to take revenge on the one-time treacherous leader of the Revolution, [Male Name]. In this he allied with [Male Name], a powerful cousin of his enemy who felt that he had been cheated away from his fair share of the spoils. According to the plan, the general would invade [Place], which was controlled by [Male Name], an ally of the rebel leader. In the meantime, his cousin would wage war against the man himself.
1,So [Male Name] marched upon [Place], which was one of the strongest cities in the land. Although it was surrounded by enemies on many sides, it was wealthy and full of food supplies. Starving the city into surrender would be impossible. The general staged several mock attacks against the city and retreated. Sometimes, he would lead his men out and then do nothing. Eventually, [Male Name] let his guard down, and the enemy troops staged the real attack and captured the outskirts of the city. His eldest son [Male Name] was with him. The boy was only sixteen years old, but he was a valiant warrior already! One of the defending generals charged at the attackers, but was easily slain by the boy's arrows. The commander was able to besiege the city, but he was later slain by boulders from a messenger sent to seek help in the war.
1,The line of [ChineseMaleLast] did not end their story there. After this event, [Male Name] remained with [Male Name] until his adulthood, but he would not accept him as his master. Instead, he hoped to become a warlord himself. So he traded his father's imperial seal for 3,000 soldiers from the man, and set out to unify the land. He found many useful friends such as the general [Male Name], the linguist [Male Name] (elder brother of the famous [Male Name]), and the benevolent [Male Name].
1,In the battle against [Male Name], one of his generals, [Male Name], wrestled with him before his army came. [Male Name] was spying on the enemy camp alone. The general managed to escape. However, the man eventually defeated the enemy with his bravery and captured the wrestler, who submitted after much coaxing. He said he would look for men to support his captor's ambitions. When he took a long time to return, the men said, "My Lord, you have let the tiger back into the forest."  But the general was a confident man, so he replied "You are wrong to mistrust him. He is a true man of his words. It's not noon yet. If I do not trust someone, I will not use him. If I use him, then I must trust him as well."  Just as he spoke these words, the man returned with 3,000 men. Such was the greatness of the general. 
1,In another battle, [Male Name] killed the envoy of the [Administrator] of [City], who was also the administrator's brother. Instead of being enraged, he fled and was killed by the general's boulder. He was such a great warrior that in one battle, he slew his enemy by shouting. His roar was so loud that the horse threw the general off, breaking his neck. And so this was how the Little Marquis founded the Kingdom of [Dynasty], one of the Three Kingdoms. He was a man of principle. He often punished those who claimed magic and wizardry. Once, he killed a sage after putting him on a burning tower and the rain fell. He said the rain fell when it did, not because the sage could command it. But then, he became crazy from exhaustion after the sage's death. He was finally murdered by three assassins, who served a noble who was killed for treason.  The general was on a hunting trip, and he defeated the assassins; however, he was struck by a poison arrow. After his death, his younger brother [Male Name] would succeed him as Marquis of the Kingdom. At his deathbed, he told him "For military matters, trust in [Male Name]. For civilian matters, listen to [Male Name]. You need not worry about the affairs of the State now. Make this a great nation." And thus is the legend of that great family; the valiant man and his great son who laid the foundations of a new Kingdom.

;RoTKBook9
1,After the retreat of the Seventeen Warlords, [Male Name] settled down in [Place], and there was no end to his power and tyranny. Many loyal servants of the [Dynasty] Dynasty were beheaded. The loyal noble [Male Name] looked at this with grave concern.  One day, his beautiful adopted daughter [ChineseFemaleFirst] was crying. He was furious, thinking she was meeting her lover. However, he later found it that she was mourning for the fate of the land and decided to involve her in a plot to get rid of the tyrannical general.
1,One day, [Male Name] invited [Male Name] to a feast and offered to give [ChineseFemaleFirst] to him as his wife. He was overjoyed. The father of the bride then said that he would send her over to him later. On the next day, he invited [Male Name] and gave his daughter to him as his mistress. When the betrothed groom heard this, he was furious. He confronted the father and was ready to kill him, but he replied "What are you talking about?!? The general said he would take her to you as a surprise." He was placated but when he returned to the palace, he found her sleeping with the general and was very angry. The would-be husband and wife later met secretly, whereupon she told him that she had been raped against her will and would commit suicide. He reached forward and prevented her from jumping off of a cliff. The general was passing by when he saw this and was very angry. He chased after the man with a spear and threw it to him, but he was too fast and managed to dodge it easily. The rift between the two had started.
1,One day, [Male Name], who was [Male Name]'s advisor and son-in-law, met his father and advised him to give up [ChineseFemaleFirst] to [Male Name], who was crucial to their strength. The general broached this idea to her, whereupon she seized a sword from the wall and tried to kill herself, but he prevented her. She said she did not want to be given to a slave after being the wife of a master warlord.
1,When [Male Name] asked [Male Name] why he did not take his advice the next morning, he gruffly replied, "How dare you question me?!? [Male Name] is my son, so my wife is his mother. It is not in the tradition to give a mother to the son. Would you give your own wife to him?!? What outrageous advice."  The man then knew that things were hopeless. Instead, the general apologized to him and gave him more money, but he was boiling inside. Nothing except the beautiful [ChineseFemaleFirst] could placate him now.
1,Finally, [Male Name] saw that his plan was working, so he conspired with [Male Name] to kill [Male Name]. He convinced the Emperor [ChineseMaleFirst] to make a fake document asking the general to accept his throne. As he was entering the Imperial palace, he was overjoyed.  First, he turned to [ChineseFemaleFirst] and told her that she would be his Empress once he became Emperor. Then, the turned to his false advisor, and told him he would be crown prince and General of the Imperial Army.  However, when he entered the Palace Grounds, he was in for a shock of his lifetime.  Armed men surrounded him.  He shouted, "What is the meaning of this? Do you dare to make treason against me, your Emperor?" Whereupon his enemies replied, "It is you who have spread treason against the Emperor, but today, you will die, traitorous one."  He then sought the aid of his would-be advisor: "Where is my son? He will defend me! Your meager army is no harm against my mighty warrior." Whereupon the man appeared. "I am here, master," but instead of helping him, he slew the tyrant.  After that, his armies broke up into factions led by [Male Name] and [Male Name].

;RoTKBook10
1,After the death of [Male Name], [Male Name] managed to seize control of the capital for a short period of time. The loyalists led by [Male Name] and [Male Name] initially fled from the capital city of [City], but they managed to lure the enemy out with a decoy, and seized the capital along with the Emperor [ChineseMaleFirst] inside it. However, the armies proceeded to fight each other for supreme power, and mistreated the Emperor.
1,One of [Male Name]'s generals kidnapped the Emperor, and [Male Name] quickly befriended this traitor, offering him help against his former master. One day, he said that he would bring the Emperor to the city of [City]. His friend did not suspect anything and allowed him to do so, but he quickly seized power by pretending loyalty to the Emperor.  He built his army and his position at the city. Soon, he was powerful enough to crush [Male Name] and [Male Name] as well. Now, he was one of the most powerful warlords of the north, after [Male Name].  Just then, he invited his father to reside with him at the city, which was now the capital of his powerful [Dynasty] kingdom. [Male Name], who was his father, resided with his friend [Male Name], who was governor of [City], a wealthy coastal city, and an admirer. He was an old, benevolent man who threw a great banquet and sent his friend off with a body of personal guards.
1,Unfortunately, the guards were up to no good. They were originally criminals who were given a second chance by the benevolent governor, but their evil habits died hard. One day, the guards murdered [Male Name] and fled with his treasures, including gifts that [Male Name] had given him.  [Male Name] was furious upon hearing this news. In his tantrum, he blamed the governor for his father's death and led a great army against [City] City. The governor had no chance against the vast army. He knew he was ruined. Just then, [Male Name], who was residing with the warlord [Male Name] at the city of [City], decided to rescue the old man. He set off with his tiny band of militia and send his younger brother [Male Name] to negotiate peace with the general.  He had no intention of signing a treaty, but events worked out in the negotiator's favor. Just then, [Male Name], now a warlord without land, invaded the general's capital base at [City]. Pretending to accept the peace terms, the general quickly returned to the city where he did battle against the warlord.
