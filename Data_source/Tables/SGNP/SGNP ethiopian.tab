#===NOTES===
#Names are comprised of a personal name followed by the personal name of the person's father or grandfather. A child's #surname is the personal name of the father rather than an inherited surname (e.g. Lebne Azmera, son of Azmera Kifle). #Women do not necessarily change their name on marriage, but when they do they take the surname used by their husband. In #dining, dishes are shared: “those who eat from the same plate will not betray each other”. They are served on and eaten #with injera, a flatbread made of the grain teff. When one diner wishes to honor another, they arrange a morsel of food #and hand feed it into the mouth of the recipient; this practice is called a Gursha. The traditional alcoholic beverage is #a honey wine called Tej.
