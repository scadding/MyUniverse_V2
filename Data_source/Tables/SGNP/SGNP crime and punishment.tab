# This generator is part of the [[Story Games Name Project]]. The following are 
# lists of serial killers, titles of law enforcement authorities, crime scene 
# locations, murder weapons, poisons, prisons and forensic techniques. The titles 
# may be combined with any country's modern lists (E.g. Modern American or 
# Psuedo-English) to generate police names, FBI Agents, Mounties or Bobbies - 
# whatever is required. It was compiled by Moyra Turkington
