;A
1,[Intro]  I had just [WentTo] [Restaurant] and ordered [RestaurantOrder].  So in [Walks] [Contact] - looking for me as usual.  Turns out [Victim] got [Killed]. [Weapon]. [Time]

;Intro
1,This one could bring the [Dice.1d8][Th] Precinct to its knees, and maybe the whole city down with it.
1,It was a crisp day, and the breeze was stiff and brisk.  Leaves mingled with trash as they blew through the alleys and side streets.
1,It was brisk.  The wind blew right through your jacket like it was a seive.
1,It was blustery out.  The snow was coming in sideways, hard.  It had only been a few hours and the streets were already a cold, brown mush.
1,It was what folks call the dead of winter.  The dirt had mixed with the ice and snow until the alleys were plastered in a crunchy, gritty brown.
1,It was freezing.  I nearly slipped on the ice outside the door.
1,It was bitterly cold out on the streets... at least the wind had died down for the moment.
1,Snow.  Since when the hell did it snow around here?  And it was coming down in buckets.
1,It was cold out.  So cold it even drove the beggars inside.  My gloves stuck to the door handle for a moment as I was getting out of [TheCar].
1,It was a dark and stormy night.
1,It was a bad week in a bad month; maybe even a bad year.  The Times were calling it the worst crime spike the city had ever seen.
1,It was a dark day in the big city.  Normal for this time of year, but something felt darker today... something more sinister.
1,It was a cool, black night.  The night stuck to you like it was something real; some black, tangible fabric made of smoke, deceit, and murder.
1,So there I was.
1,Rain.  Hard, drumming, pounding rain.  It'd been coming down for hours.
1,It was raining; the kind of rain that you'd hope would just clean the filth right off the streets.
1,The air was cool and moist downtown, and the clouds were heavy-laden and ripe with rain.
1,The smog mixed with the muggy air and it was stifling.  I wanted to get out of town like a rat leaving a sinking ship, but there was some pressing business to attend to.
1,The air was heavy in the big city; the heat roiling off the pavement was stifling.
1,I remember it like it was yesterday.
1,I remember this one case... I was fresh on the Force.  Had a thin mustache and a thinner wallet... but even back then I had a sharp nose for hot leads.
1,It was a few years back.  I had just gotten on the Force.
1,I remember when I was still just a rookie, just another gumshoe bumbling his way through the concrete jungle.
1,It was an oppressively hot day in the city.  The blacktop was baking, and the broads on 1[Th] and Main were wearing even less than usual.
1,It was as hot as I'd ever remembered it.  Just blistering.  You could cook breakfast right on the sidewalk; that is, if you could bear to eat off of the filthiest imaginable surface on earth.
1,It was a heat wave; worst in years.  Scalding, scorching, sweltering heat... it was so hot the newsies had gone on strike.  Hell, even the thermometers had gone on strike... about 20 degrees ago.
1,Well, this is how it all went down.
1,Listen... it started like this.
1,It was another one of those days.
1,The lights, the smoke, the grime, the city itself... seemed to be alive that day.
