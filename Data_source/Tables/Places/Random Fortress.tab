;Start
1,At first, the PCs will see [Numberonetwelve] towers. Each has about [Numberonefour] defender(s) visible (there are actually [Numberonetwelve] times that number total) and about [Numberonefour] will arrive per round in the case of an alarm. The outer walls are [Threedtwentyptone][Threedtwentypttwo] feet tall and the towers extend [Numberonetwenty] feet above them.<br />*If it's a seafront fort, there will be [Numberonefour][Threedtwentypttwo] feet of [Terraintype] ground before the walls start.<br />*Due to the condition of the walls, climb checks are at [Climbchecknumber]. <br />*The lowest windows are [Dtwentyplusthirtydigitone][Threedtwentypttwo] feet up.<br />*The initial volley from the towers in case of an unexpected attack will be [Missiletype]. The second volley in case of a siege, an anticipated attack, or a small but persistent raiding party (like a bunch of PCs) will consist of [Secondaryfire]--unless it is a goblin fortress, in which case the response will consist of [Goblinfire].<br />*''Additional security measures include:'' <br />[Barbican] [Stair] [Moat] [Secondarywalls]<br />*''Also:''<br /> [Complications] [Complicationstwentyfive] [Complicationstwentyfive] [Complicationstwentyfive]<br><br>
