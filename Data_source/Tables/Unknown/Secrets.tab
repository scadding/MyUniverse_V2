1,when i'm mean to you, it isn't because i'm taking out anger on you. it isn't because i'm just messing with you. when i'm mean to you, it's the only time you ever see me honest.
1,your signals aren't mixed at all, i'm purposefully reading them wrong.
1,I know you have feelings for me stronger than friendship, and I'm too selfish to stop you.
1,I hate your boyfriend even though I'm the one who put your relationship together.
1,I can't tell any of you anything because then you'd all know my weaknesses.
1,I'll always be there for you the second you need it, but I need what I ask for until then.
1,I'm sick of you walking around thinking you're better than anyone.
1,no not this no no i won't ever go back do you remember i was on the phone i was telling you how scared i was i was begging you to help me even though you couldn't get me out why didn't you come see me again there why did you let me face my parents alone for two days, you were the only one who could have helped and when i got out you had drawn away 'for my own good' they said.
1,I know your secret and I want to tell. It's eating away at me that I know and can't tell anyone, especially the one person who really needs to know. But you insist on lying.
1,I want to scream all of this into your faces until you're shocked into silence.
1,I want you to feel like an outsider in your own group, I want you all to feel like aliens on your own planet.
1,You know, I'm sick of you. I'm sick of your beauty, I'm sick of being jealous. I can't stand you, but I wish I was you.
1,Your life makes me sick. I wish it was mine.
1,If you're going out with him, just tell me. I still hate him and I don't approve, but I /understand/.
1,How dare you ask me if I'm depressed, like I'm, about to off myself? How dare you? Just because I'm not as smiley as I was the day before, just because I look a little tired.
1,I hate your friends, I hate your boyfriend. He treats you so bad-give him up.
1,I can't believe that you'd say that about your own son.
1,I can't believe that you are gone forever now.
1,I'm not a toy, and I don't appreciate this from you. It isn't fair and you know how self-conscious I am.
1,I wish I was her. She's so lucky. You are too.
1,I wish you'd stop worrying. I'll be okay.

1,i'm a different person every day. if i seem stable to you, it's because you aren't seeing the real me.

1,I'm beginning to think that all the ribbons and medals and certificates and awards really don't mean anything. They're just bragging rights. And yet, I want more. I want to succeed.

1,Being around guys makes me feel like I have someone protecting me.
1,I want to take on everyone else's problems, but I know now how amazing it is to have someone be there when I cry and take care of me and I feel guilty for having not only let it happen but that it made me feel happy and loved.

1,I'm tired of how stuck up they all are. I'm really stuck up too though.
1,I was sexually abused as a child and again when I was sixteen, sometimes I forget and that scares me when I remember. I forgave the person who did it to me as a child. I'm mad at myself for not pressing charges on the guy who did it when I was sixteen.
1,i won't ever go back.
1,I feel like I have to stick up for the rest of the females in the world because all the girls at my school are toothpicks, sluts, and dumb blonds.
1,The walls in my room are full of reasons that there was a person who once lived here and she had a mind and a hand and there was a connection between the two.
1,Everything i see reminds me of it. i think about it all the time. it won't ever go away.
1,All of my friends think I'm some sort of carefree lunatic because I conceal my problems as best as I can.
1,I told one of my friends that I was stressed out, and this was her response: "*** gets stressed? carefree ***? that's so weird. what about, like school?" It makes me sad that my friends don't think of me like I'm an actual person. The message makes me feel like they think I'm some sort of robot without thoughts or a soul.
1,I grow out my nails to an insane cat like length so that I feel like I have some way to fight back in any situation.
1,When my enemies insult me, I don't care, but when my friends say the same sort of things, I'm crushed.

1,I make faces at the mirror.
1,I think I have a mild form of short-term memory loss.
1,i can't figure out what's important. i can't figure out why anything's here. i can't figure out why we are living like royalty and some people in our own country can't get rice. i can't figure out why people would try and stop genetically modified/cloned things from being sold, when it is not harmful and could help a lot of people.
1,I sometimes feel weirdly detached from my life. i will suddenly find, upon being asked, that i really have to think about how old i am. I'll here my name, and be surprised to find that they're talking about me.
1,I enjoy rainy days more than sunny days.
1,i think that i just get so caught up in my own thoughts sometimes that coming back to reality can be weird.
1,When I was in elementary school, kids used to make fun of me because of my name. I'm still very self conscious, but I don't have problems making friends, nor am I shy.
1,I don't like people who like things because other people told them too.
1,Now when people go up to me and say, "omg, did u kill Ian?!?!1" I just answer, "YES."
1,I once went fishing for bats and when I caught one I ate it just to see what bat meat tastes like and it tasted like mosquitoes.
1,Part of me refuses to accept what she told Erika as anything more than an excuse
1,I don't believe I'll ever die. That's why I'm not scarred of a thing I suppose. Everyone says I'm brave, but I'm just ignorant.
1,I write to escape the real world, yet I always come back thinking about people. Friends and crushes. I mean the people I try to forget about for a time.
1,i wonder what it's like to be dead. I'm not suicidal, but I wonder what its like AFTER death. Like in heaven or hell or if you just wander

1,i feel like I'm dying from the inside out and there's nothing anyone can do about it, I'm too far gone....
1,I'm sometimes bothered by how fat I am but I do nothing to change it and all in all I don't think I'd like myself if I tried to change myself radically. I'm fat, and more often than not it really doesn't bother me. I look good even if I'm not skinny.
1,i cry whenever i see the movie Dumbo
1,I think I'm schizophrenic. I used to make fun of it all the time, like pretending I was, but I don't try to anymore. It just kind of happens.
1,Everyone thinks that I have the perfect life, and I pretty much do, but I get really unhappy sometimes because I am usually expected to be perfect.
1,I believe there is no such thing as perfection.
1,I want to believe in happy endings, but humanity is incapable of causing anything but destruction (and it only takes a selfish few), thusly causing every ending to be angry, sad, and anything but happy.
1,sometimes i dress up in random costume whenever nobody is home, then i walk around like that the whole day...
1,I want to look more hot and less cute.
1,i think that i am so ugly and that nobody likes me because i really look like a guy in other people's eyes and that when my boyfriend says that i am pretty i really don't believe him.
1,I'm an idealist.
1,One of the big reasons I'm going to school out of state--as I finally admitted to myself last night--is so that there is no random chance of me running into my ex ever again.
1,I know that the girl I am shunning lies and pretends to know more than she actually does.
1,There's something wrong with me
1,It was only till I realized nobody had ever, EVER been there for me that I callused up and learned that hating every living thing is much more fun than squirming in my own emotional agony and trying to pretend each little insignificant human worm was worth my time and patience.
1,I question both the theory of evolution and the theory of creationism but I favor evolution.
1,I always instinctively feel like I'm part of something that's going to happen, and I'm always looking for ways to make whatever that something is happen.

1,Everyone tells me I was molested but somehow I never thought I was.
