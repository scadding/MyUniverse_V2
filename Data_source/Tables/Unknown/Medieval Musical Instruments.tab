1,Troubadours - A troubadour was a travelling musician. The Troubadours travelled from one village to the next and many also travelled abroad. The troubadours therefore served a dual purpose and spread the latest news across the realm. The themes of the songs sung by the Troubadours mainly dealt with chivalry and courtly love - romantic ballads. The troubadour would play for common people and nobles.
1,Minstrels - A minstrel was a servant first employed as a castle or court musician. The name 'minstrel' means a "little servant". Minstrels often created their own ballads but they were also famous for memorising long poems based on myths and legends which were called 'chansons de geste'.  The themes of the songs sung by the Troubadors also dealt with chivalry and courtly love but they also told stories of far lands and historical events. The Minstrels were replaced by Troubadours and also started to move around and were known as 'Wandering Minstrels'
