1,Awful eyes, black Persian beggar,
1,Harlequinesque, hair plaited heather,
1,A sprite in the house of my sight.
1,There's a crawling sensation
1,An Astral vibration
1,That's sucking me into your sight
1,I can tell by your hair In the juniper chair
1,And the piratey twist of your mouth
1,I've constructed your frame In a plasticine game
1,And your eyes are the sweets of my youth
1,But I'm naked and bare in the ice of your stare
1,And I'm useless at telling the truth
1,So I hide with my head in the tent of the bed
1,And my body is sucked through your eyes
1,Then I quiver and shiver and start to deliver the goods
1,Then I vanish in size.
1,Meeting behind the iron sling
1,My brandy tongue was like a caterpillar thing
1,Suzy-hung up on Joan of Arc
1,Cloudily gave me the key to the dark
1,Scraping the lice from my bed
1,I sussed we were teleported into his head
1,A wormy blood train expected our feet
1,But I cradled Suzy's head in my lap
1,And fitted the stair to her gap
1,And led her off the Astral plane
1,Sculpting her features in flesh
1,Her Alice eyes scan the mythical scene
1,And rose on the veiny snake train
1,And prayed to his bastille sky brain
1,The driver was a cancer growth cell
1,His words were just recorded tapes of Hell
1,He left us in the room of faded scrolls
1,In a window wall we saw a good thought chained
1,But knifed into a portion of his brain
1,Was a whitish throught back to the green Amazon leach
1,It was interlocked between his angel eyes
1,Which were bleached transparent
1,And his marble lips were paralysed
1,We swum and ran knee deep in plasma
1,The cello stairs reduced in size
1,The sunken landscape eclipsing into
1,A pair of blue Tazmanian eyes
1,Scenescof then became a midget
1,Scratching at the bone in my knee
1,Then an eat without a body
1,Listening to my mental sea
1,Suzy sat behind some loose flesh
1,Her pirate thoughts were both young and old
1,Reduced to wearing blonde lot earings
1,She held me near she felt the cold
1,We ran just like young fauns
1,And me I fought a great worm
1,Sent to taste my jaguar feet
1,And used his skin to make my wings begin
1,I sussed and stole a scene from Icarus
1,And flew us above some uncooked meat
1,A plastic hook pierced through my Instep
1,I flew too near his Brutus heart
1,But Suzy hip to all the future
1,Played the Victorian heroine's part
1,With my busted leg and rusty head
1,And Suzy in a Hipolite dream
1,I brandished my breathing machette
1,While Scenescof prepared his Gorgon machine
1,It flew out from its eyelid island
1,It's Vulcan teeth and hydra spray
1,It's scaley tang claws ripping rainbows
1,It moved it's cave lips in worlds of movement
1,It makes a sound it seemed to say
1,Keep cool the satin sun is yours
1,I see your youthy aura's bright
1,Expell your tears and jungle fears
1,I'm here it's going to be alright
1,Then Scenescof screamed his charlatan hair
1,Quick silvered from black to grey
1,Then the Gorgon moved the lizard dial
1,And was transformed into Grecian dust
1,And from the sand was born a blacked horned storm
1,With a charger and a spear
1,As he moved his limbs
1,The legend shaft sliced Scenescof from ear to ear.
1,A ragged youth with eyes of glass
1,His shaven skull he etched with ease
1,The silent scriptures of the trees
1,A chosen man begged by the wayside
1,A horse came soon and died before him
1,And said eat.
1, The icy claws of earth are crawling
1,Upon my baby's brow and calling
1,Please come home.
1,A vagabond, a weaver warrior
1,Produced a loom, a cheese and chopper
1,And said choose.
1,Unto the grasping bats-wing of the winter pincer
1,The horned dog guarding grandly
1,Daughters of the Sun
1,The bull of gold that's old
1,Beyond the songs of man
1,Keeps watch upon the fates
1,When they misweave your strand.
1,A stork of silk
1,With rubies in its nest
1,You gashed the heart of my heart
1,Like a Portuguese Witch
1,I'd planned for you this land 
1,but you devoured my hand.
1,The huntress stands, with peacock hands she'd take me to where she lie
1,I come from a time where the burning of trees was a crime,
1,I lived by a sea where to be was a thing of true joy,
1,My people were fair and had sky in their hair,
1,But now they're content to wear stars on their brows.

1,Ju-ju beads holding me all together
1,Gazelle girl striding through your palace
1,Precious jewels nestle in your hair
1,Rameses born with platinum future
1,I saw a little man who had a toy trumpet
1,He sat on a stone with his lips to the mouthpiece
1,He was deaf dumb and blind so he couldn't quite make it
1,When out of the horn came a solid silver genie
1,Who was made just to make the little man happy
1,As the man made sounds the genie painted fluid,
1,Mind-blowing visions on the little man's brain-box
1,Everybody small with no lips to play the trumpet
1,Everybody living inside a giant deaf aid
1,Everybody's eyes crucified to the tapestry
1,Woven by the giant with the solid silver genie
1,Who plays the trumpet
1,Wielder of words is steeped within traditional verbs
1,And curiously a dented top hat
1,Discovered in the moonlit Laundromat
1,A busted cheroot is smoking on the heel of his boot
1,Eating evenings of waste
1,So sad they should be owning a man who's
1,Thicker than the forestry from where they began.
1,Graceful fat Sheba, she works with a meatcleaver
1,Sweating behind the meat counter
1,Her skin, it leaks liquid, the odour is sickly
1,Her features aren't unlike a swan
1,Her poetic, gluttonic waist is impressive
1,She smiles as she hacks up a pig
1,My baby don't realise I'm hypnotised
1,It's all put together with alligator leather

1,Princely and torn, grasping the horn
1,Of the maenads of May.
1,Sleepy dreaming of dark
1,Silver Satyrs in parks
1,Statues that say, worship the day
1,For only humans you are.
1,Channels churning the grime
1,Inky dreams of our time
1,Into the Sun, where the white one
1,Poems them into a rhyme.
1,On a hill the clear shrill
