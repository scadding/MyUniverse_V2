Description
===========

        This command generates a religious profile following the system given
in WBH. Invoked with a simple "religion" it runs in an interactive mode, 
generating one religious profile, and asking whether a repeat is required.

UWP
---

If a profile for a specific UWP is required the UWP can be entered when the 
command is invoked, using the -u parameter. The UWP must have the format:

        A777777-7

The paramater is then:

        -uA777777-7

Output File
-----------

If output is desired to a file rather than the screen then the -o parameter is 
used. The filename immediately follows the -o. No screen output will be
generated. eg:

        -oregina.rel

puts output to a file regina.rel.

Multiple Profiles
-----------------

If more than one profile is required then the +n paramter is used, where 'n'
is the number of profiles required. In file output mode this number will be
written to the file, seperated by a new line. In interactive mode this number
will be generated before each request to continue. eg:

        +10

generates 10 profiles.

RELIGION.STR
------------

This file contains the string definitions used by RELIGION.TTP. You can change
the wording after the second colon to suit your own requirements.
