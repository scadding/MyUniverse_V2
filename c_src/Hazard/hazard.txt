Command Format
==============

hazard [-cuhp] [-ofilename] [-nnumber] [-h[xx]] [-s]

Generates hazard profile as given in Challenge or decodes a given profile.

-cuhp      	Decode Universal Hazard Profile 'uhp', else random.
-ofilename 	Put output to 'filename'.
-nnumber   	Generate 'number' profiles.
-s			  	Suppress screen output ( only if file output enabled ).
-h				Provides general help.
-h[xx]     	Provide help information.

		na = Nature, Secondary Characteristics...
		tx = toxic, ox = oxidizing, co = corrosive, ex = explosive
		hi = highly inflammable, bi = biohazard, ra = radioactive              
		
		sp = Species Affected,     	at = Atmospheric Tolerance
		tm = Temperature Tolerance,  	hu = Humidity Tolerance
		gv = Gravitic Tolerance,     	fm = Form
		ms = Mass

Description
===========

	This command generates a hazard  description following the system given
in CHA-31. Invoked with a simple "hazard" it runs in an interactive mode, 
generating one hazard description, and asking whether a repeat is required.
The program can also be used to decode a UHP profile.


UHP
---

To decode a UHP include the UHP on the command line following -u, eg:

	-u777-7777-77
	
The UHP must be in the format 777-7777-77.

If you do not care about a characteristic use an "x" to represent it, eg:

	-u777-77xx-77


Output File
-----------

If output is desired to a file then the -o parameter is used. The filename 
immediately follows the -o. eg:

        -oonesium.uhp

puts output to a file onesium.uhp.

Suppressing Screen Output
-------------------------

If you do not want output displayed on the screen, when you have chosen the
-o parameter, then add the -s switch. ie

      	-oonesium.uhp -s
      	
Multiple Profiles
-----------------

If more than one profile is required then the -n paramter is used, where 'n'
is the number of profiles required. In file output mode this number will be
written to the file, seperated by a new line. In interactive mode this 
number will be generated before each request to continue. eg:

        -n10

generates 10 profiles.


Help
----

Two levels of help are available. Putting -h as a parameter just gives a 
short description of the command and its parameters. To get details of
all the "values" of a parameter in the profile, or more help on a command
parameter use -hxx, where xx is one of the two letter codes given above.

HAZARD.STR
==========

This file contains the string definitions used by HAZARD.TTP. You can change
the wording after the second colon to suit your own requirements.
