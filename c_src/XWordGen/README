The original program was written by Dan Corrin (dan@engrg.uwo.ca) for
a platform I am unfamiliar with.  I have provided a Unix port.  I will
certainly support this bastardized version of his code, if he doesn't
want to bother with it.

To compile under Unix, simply type "make", and with any luck, you will
wind up with an executable version of the wordgen file.

To run, select the wordgen description file you wish to use (words.asl
for Aslan words, words.dro for Droyne, words.kkr for K'kree, words.va1
or words.va2 for Vargr, words.vil for Vilani and words.zho for
Zhodani) and execute wordgen as follows:

wordgen wordgen_description_file

For example, "wordgen words.asl" gave me the following output:
OIRYARLUI

This will generate a single word.  To generate more, simply tack # of
syllable parameters onto the end of that command to create more words
of the specified number of syllables.
For example:

wordgen words.zho 2 3 3
CHINSZRNJ IANTSHENCHFLIB VIDRZHATLIANT

To expand the list of possible word generation, merely make a copy of
the "words" template file, filling in the appropriate areas.

E-mail me with any problems/suggestions
