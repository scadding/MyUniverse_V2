When playing roleplaying games (RPGs), it often adds some realism if the GM
can determine what kind of weather is occuring.  This program generates random
weather for a year that is tunable to various climates.  Several example
climates are included: north, south, and mid atlantic, gulf, and north
pacific.

In addition, several different calendars are included: Gregorian, medieval
Japanese, and the Middle Earth calendar detailed in the appendices of
Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.

The details of these are provided so that the user can create his or her own
climate profiles or calendars.

Please send any improvements, new climate profiles, new calendars, or
better versions of the current climate profiles to one of the addresses below.
