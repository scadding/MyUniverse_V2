       This code was written on a PC and tested under the Lattice-C,
       Microsoft-C and Turbo-C compilers. It should work under most
       C compilers but be careful of long arithmetic. I would be most
       keen to know modifications that are needed for various compilers.
       To check your executable is 100% correct the system at coordinates

       I strongly encourage people to write subsidiary programs, e.g.
       to map a subsector, plot trade routes, .... Usefull programs
       will be added to later releases.
