                             IN ASSOCIATION WITH

                         A R N E L I A   C R E D I T

                    WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THE 43RD ANNUAL

                        D E T E   --   E E R A    RACE


       THERE ARE STILL A FEW TICKETS FOR THE RACE TO BE APPLIED FOR
       SPONSORED BY THE TRAVELLER'S AID SOCIETY, ARNELIA CREDIT AND
       A FEW LOCAL BUSINESSES.

       THE RACES CENTRES AROUND WHO CAN GET FROM DETE (10000,10000,10000)
       TO EERA (10032,10029,10024) THE FASTEST ON THE ARNELIA YEARLY
       COMMUTER TICKET. ENTRANTS WILL RECEIVE ONE COMMUTER TICKET
       VALID FROM THE DATE OF TRAVEL AND AN ARNELIA CREDIT CARD WHOSE
       LIMITS WILL BE ASSESSED INDIVIDUALLY. THE WINNER, AND CERTAIN
       RUNNERS UP, WILL BE REWARDED WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
       COST OF THE TICKET AND THE COST OF THE JOURNEY IF PAID FOR
       INDIVIDUALLY. RETURN FARE TO DETE WILL ALSO BE COVERED.

       THOSE APPLYING FOR SPONSORED TICKED MUST BE AGED 18 TO 24 AND
       PREFERENCE WILL BE GIVEN TO THOSE ATTENDING THIRD LEVEL EDUCATION
       OR WORK EXPERIENCE. CERTAIN APPLICANTS MAY RECEIVE A GRANT COVERING
       INITIAL TRANSPORTATION TO DETE. ALL APPLICANTS ARE REQUESTED TO
       SEND A FULL RESUME TO THEIR NEAREST BRANCH OF TAS AS SOON AS
       POSSIBLE IF THEY WISH TO ENSURE A PLACE.

       Well maybe not as exciting as exploring a ringworld but
       a lot less time consuming. Anyone who has tried the same stunt
       on a European Inter-Rail ticket will sympathise.

       This is mainly a one-to-one (player to ref) game but if people's
       paths cross I am sure there will be scope for interactive
       role-playing. Being able to run the 1,000,000 star level
       one system generator is not absolutely essential but will
       be an invaluable aid.

       I don't envision the response to be so overwhelming that there
       will be a shortage a places but I would put the ceiling at
       about eight people.
