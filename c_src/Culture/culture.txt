Description
===========

	This command generates a culture description following the system given
in TD-16. Invoked with a simple "culture" it runs in an interactive mode, 
generating one culture description, and asking whether a repeat is required.

UWP
---

If a profile for a specific UWP is required the UWP can be entered when the 
command is invoked, using the -u parameter. The UWP must have the format:

        A777777-7

The paramater is then:

        -uA777777-7

Output File
-----------

If output is desired to a file then the -o parameter is used. The filename 
immediately follows the -o. eg:

        -oregina.cul

puts output to a file regina.cul.

Suppressing Screen Output
-------------------------

If you do not want output displayed on the screen, when you have chosen the
-o parameter, then add the -s swicth. ie

      	-oregina.cul -s
      	
Multiple Profiles
-----------------

If more than one profile is required then the -n parameter is used, where
'n' is the number of profiles required. In file output mode this number will
be written to the file, seperated by a new line. In interactive mode this 
number will be generated before each request to continue. eg:

        -n10

generates 10 profiles.

Help
----

Two levels of help are available. Putting -h as a parameter just gives a 
short description of the command and its parameters. To get details of
all the "values" of a parameter in the profile, or more help on a command
parameter use -hxx, where xx is one of the two letter codes given above.


CULTURE.STR
===========

This file contains the string definitions used by CULTURE.TTP. You can 
change the wording after the second colon to suit your own requirements.
