hiya,

	This is an announcement that my ship design is being released
as is to the tml.  The user interface on the program is still quite poor,
when I get some spare time I might improve it.  The program doesn't allow you
to save the work that you've done so far and continue the design later, so
before you start designing you should make sure you have plently of time
available (one hour should be more than enough for just about anything
once you are used to the program).

	The program currently does not handle the following sections
of the ship design process (the first column is the section number and the
rest of the line is a description of the deficiency):

1 Planetoid hulls (of any kind)
1 Hulls of a non-standard size.
2 Non-power-plant power supplies (batteries, solar cells, fuel cells)
	scale efficiencies are handled in an ugly manner.
2 Suspensions and transmissions
6 Guns (the smallest weapons I support are turrets)
6 Magazine requirements for missiles
7 Basic obscuration devices
10 some problems specifing fuel requirements & purification plants

It also doesn't evaluate the design at all (well, it gives the current
agility and it sometimes warns you of illegal designs).  I don't see this
as beng too much of a problem, design evaluation is quite quick once you
get into the hang of it.

Despite these short comings, the program is still very useful.  Designs can be
modified easily without all the painful recalculations necessary when working
by hand.
