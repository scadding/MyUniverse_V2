	I ported it from DOS to Unix. Had to get rid of all those nasties 
	of conio.h (replaced with ncurses), and moreover, change everything
	related to the output, due to the assumption that a screen has 
	80x25 characters.

	Further consequence was that printing the same output to the
	screen and to a file just wasn't the same. It's in two different
	functions now.
	
	Then a bug in the saving of files was corrected when no filename
	was given. Now a default filename is assumed. 
	
	Up/Down Arrowkeys don't work right now. Maybe I'll do this. Maybe
	I'll do this by porting the whole thing to C and use SLang. ;)
